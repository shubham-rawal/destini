# Destini ðŸ¤”

## Goal

In this app, I have created a choose your own adventure game like Bandersnatch. During this project, I have revised my understanding of Dart OOP concepts and  how to implement user input (also throwing errors if fields are left empty) and implemented them in the finished app.

## Finished App

The finished App consists of a Welcome Screen that consists of AnimatedContainers that change colors when tapped to make the app fun to use. The Welcome Screen asks for the User's Name (this field cannot be left empty). The next page asks the User's age and opens up a datePicker set to the current date when the Calendar button is pressed. 

After these inputs, the storyline begins. Currently, the app features a single storyline that may take different turns BASED ON THE USER'S CHOICES. This has been implemented using a custom storyBrain class that controls the direction in which the story proceeds based on the user's input. The finished app gif has been attached below:

## Future Ideas (to be thought upon)

Idea is to include multiple storylines based on the user's input of their names and age. By using these inputs and integrating them within the storyline, we can create Personalized Stories that change their course based on the user's input. These stories would be based on different themes that the user may decide based on their interests, or may choose to continue with a random story.

This app is designed for kids, and including personalized stories and multiple stories based on different themes would make the app interactive, creative and fun to use.

## Things I have learnt through this app
>As I am new to Dart & Flutter, this section summarises the concepts I have learnt through this module.
- Implementing Object Oriented Programming Concepts through practical usage.
- Playing with TextFields and AnimatedContainers to understand how they work.
- Understanding how Lists in Dart work.
- Understanding how to implement classes and using them to direct the app to display different results based on the user inputs.
- Navigation and Routes in Dart.
